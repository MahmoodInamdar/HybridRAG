# HybridRAG

I implemented a HybridRAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system using Pinecone for efficient vector and keyword-based search. This approach enhances AI-driven question answering by combining dense embeddings with traditional search to improve relevance. By integrating LLMs with Pineconeâ€™s vector database, the system delivers faster, more accurate, and context-aware responses for complex queries. ðŸš€
